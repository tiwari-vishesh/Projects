Combining my two passions, I embarked on an exciting journey to dive deep into the data of the 2022 tournament, crafting a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI. 📈💻

Using web scraping techniques with Bright Data, I collected raw data, leveraging Python's Pandas library to clean and wrangle the information into shape. 🐍✨ MS Excel played a crucial role in organizing the data, setting the stage for the magic to happen in Power BI.

This project wasn't just about crunching numbers; it was a testament to the power of analytical skills in unraveling insights. From match statistics to player performances, every data point told a compelling story of cricketing excellence and strategic brilliance. 🌟🏏
